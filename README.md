# StreesDetection-Using-Ml
Here we see how can we measure that person is in stress or not by Analysing text written.

Stress detection refers to the process of identifying and measuring physiological or behavioral indicators of stress in an individual. This can include monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol levels, and changes in facial expressions or speech patterns. Stress detection can be used in a variety of settings, such as in medical research or in occupational health and safety.
There are several approaches to detecting stress using machine learning, some of which include:

  --Analyzing physiological signals such as heart rate and galvanic skin response
  --Analyzing speech patterns, such as pitch and intonation
  --Analyzing text written by the individual, such as emails or social media posts
  --Using a combination of multiple methods to increase accuracy
  --Use of emotion recognition API provided by companies like Microsoft, IBM and Google.
